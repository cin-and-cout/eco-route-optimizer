##  Project Summary

**EcoRoute Optimizer** is an intelligent navigation and simulation platform designed to minimize carbon footprints. Unlike traditional GPS applications that prioritize the fastest path, this system performs a multi-dimensional analysis of **elevation gradients, real-time weather conditions, and traffic patterns** to identify the most fuel-efficient route.

The project features a high-performance **FastAPI** backend for complex physics-based cost modeling, an interactive **Leaflet.js** web dashboard, and a sophisticated **Autonomous Agent** that simulates dynamic environment changes and performs real-time re-routing.

##  System Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture, ensuring clear separation between core logic, API services, and the simulation agent.

### Core Components
1.  **Frontend**: Interactive web UI built with HTML5, Bootstrap, and Leaflet Maps for real-time visualization.
2.  **API Engine**: FastAPI-powered backend providing RESTful endpoints for route calculation and TTS generation.
3.  **Autonomous Agent**: A CLI-based simulation engine (`autonomous_agent.py`) that demonstrates the system's ability to react to dynamic environmental shifts.
4.  **Neural Voice Service**: Integration with Microsoft Edge TTS for high-quality, natural-sounding route guidance.

##  Control Flow & Logic

The application follows a rigorous data pipeline to convert raw geographic data into environmental insights:

### Environmental Intelligence
*   **Weather Service**: Fetches live data from Open-Meteo API.
*   **Elevation Service**: Analyzes terrain profiles via Open-Elevation API.
*   **Traffic Service**: Infers road conditions using OSRM duration deltas and historical patterns.
*   **Cost Model**: A physics-based engine that calculates fuel consumption (L) and CO2 (kg) by weighing distance, ascent, and external resistance factors.

##  Key Features

*   ** Eco-Routing**: Prioritizes routes with the lowest environmental impact.
*   ** Terrain Awareness**: Incorporates elevation gain into fuel consumption calculations.
*   ** Dynamic Weather**: Adjusts estimates based on real-time precipitation and wind speed.
*   ** Autonomous Rerouting**: Agent-driven simulation that switches routes as conditions evolve.
*   ** AI Voice Guidance**: Crystal-clear neural voice summaries of trip metrics.
*   ** API Key Free**: Utilizes open-source and free-tier APIs (Open-Meteo, Open-Elevation, OSRM, Edge TTS) for zero-cost operation.
